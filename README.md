# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

This week I had to create a password generator with the starter code. This was a challenge for me because I'm having a hard time with JavaScript. For a few days I just sat at stared at my computer just thinking on how to start. I finally started to google information to guide me with this assignment. I was able to start my code and make sense of what I was doing, but then I ran into road blocks again. I'm trying to learn not to stress about the road blocks because they will always be there with coding, which makes things more interesting in completed the task we are want to complete.

## User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
