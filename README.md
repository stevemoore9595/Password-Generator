# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

This week I had to create a password generator with the starter code. This was a challenge for me because I'm having a hard time with JavaScript. For a few days I just sat at stared at my computer just thinking on how to start. I finally started to google information to guide me with this assignment. I was able to start my code and make sense of what I was doing, but then I ran into road blocks again. I'm trying to learn not to stress about the road blocks because they will always be there with coding, which makes things more interesting in completed the task we are want to complete.

## User Story

I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
